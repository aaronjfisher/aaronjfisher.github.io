You can do a lot with a degree from HSWW, but the one thing that’s hard to do is to become a scientist. In fact, there's very little emphasis on science in the HSWW culture. Students learn plenty of spells and potion recipes, but nobody at the school has a good understanding of how magic actually works -- after thousands of years, they still call it magic! It’s possible that no one in the wizarding world has ever studied the mechanisms underlying magic, but I don't buy it. How could wizards have witnessed the muggle scientific revolution, and not looked at wands under a microscope? No, there must be scientific research institutions in the wizarding world too, which leads to only conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hogwarts is a technical school.&lt;/em&gt; It's where you go to learn a craft. It's great at sports, but not so great with cutting edge research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, HSWW &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; on the front lines of preventing a global holocaust, while professors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang Institute were off in their ivory towers, presumably debating time travel paradoxes or developing new languages for object-oriented spell casting. When sh*t hit the fan, HSWW stepped up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there must be another school out there that’s experimenting with new yeast strains for butter-beer, and running clinical trials on healing charms. If you like science, that’s the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: There's a potential analogy to black box models here, but this post  really doesn't have much to do with statistics. Future posts will be more relevant to stats, with high probability.&lt;/em&gt;

Some specific topics include: surviving a PhD, enjoying a PhD, designing intuitive graphics, and dealing with high dimensional data. There will also be musings from time to time about food/cooking, and culture in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to keeps these posts clear and concise, with working code examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Aaron Fisher</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-03-18:mission-statement.html</guid><category>blog</category></item></channel></rss>
