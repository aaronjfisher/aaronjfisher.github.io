		<div><p>I sometimes hear people say that with they could've gone to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (HSWW), but there’s a drawback of HSWW that's often overlooked. You can do a lot with a degree from HSWW, but the one thing that’s hard to do is to become a scientist. In fact, there's very little emphasis on science in the HSWW culture. Students learn plenty of spells and potion recipes, but nobody at the school has a good understanding of how magic actually works -- after thousands of years, they still call it magic! It’s possible that no one in the wizarding world has ever studied the mechanisms underlying magic, but I don't buy it. How could wizards have witnessed the muggle scientific revolution, and not looked at wands under a microscope? No, there must be scientific research institutions in the wizarding world too, which leads to only conclusion:</p>
<p><em>Hogwarts is a technical school.</em> It's where you go to learn a craft. It's great at sports, but not so great with cutting edge research.</p>
<p>Of course, HSWW <em>was</em> on the front lines of preventing a global holocaust, while professors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang Institute were off in their ivory towers, presumably debating time travel paradoxes or developing new languages for object-oriented spell casting. When shit hit the fan, HSWW stepped up. </p>
<p>That said, there must be another school out there that’s experimenting with new yeast strains for butter-beer, and running clinical trials on healing charms. If you like science, that’s the place to be.</p>

<em>Note: There's a potential analogy to black box models here, but this post  really doesn't have much to do with statistics. Future posts will be more relevant to stats, with high probability.</em></p></div>
